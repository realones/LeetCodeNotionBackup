There are `n` **1-indexed** robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.

You are given **0-indexed** integer arrays `positions`, `healths`, and a string `directions` (`directions[i]` is either **'L'** for **left** or **'R'** for **right**). All integers in `positions` are **unique**.

All robots start moving on the line **simultaneously** at the **same speed** in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will **collide**.

If two robots collide, the robot with **lower health** is **removed** from the line, and the health of the other robot **decreases** **by one**. The surviving robot continues in the **same** direction it was going. If both robots have the **same** health, they are both ****removed from the line.

Your task is to determine the **health** of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same **order** that the robots were given, ****i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.

Return *an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.*

**Note:** The positions may be unsorted.

**Example 1:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/15/image-20230516011718-12.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/15/image-20230516011718-12.png)

```
Input: positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = "RRRRR"
Output: [2,17,9,15,10]
Explanation: No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].

```

**Example 2:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/15/image-20230516004433-7.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/15/image-20230516004433-7.png)

```
Input: positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = "RLRL"
Output: [14]
Explanation: There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].

```

**Example 3:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/15/image-20230516005114-9.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/15/image-20230516005114-9.png)

```
Input: positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = "RLRL"
Output: []
Explanation: Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= positions.length == healths.length == directions.length == n <= 105`
- `1 <= positions[i], healths[i] <= 109`
- `directions[i] == 'L'` or `directions[i] == 'R'`
- All values in `positions` are distinct

Solution:

The idea is straightforward and not hard, but the implementation with int* can be summarized and complex

```cpp
/*
================================
n robots
positions: unique
healths:
directions: L / R

in same possition - collide - 
    low health die, high health-=1
    same health, both die
    
requirment: give the final healths arr, in init order

n:1~1e5
================================
stk
from l to r, 
    if ->, push to stack, 
    if <-, trim top till cur disappear, or all stk ele disappear

*/

public:
    vector<int> survivedRobotsHealths(vector<int>& positions, vector<int>& healths, string directions) {
        int n=positions.size();
        
        //sort on position
        vector<tuple<int,int*,char>> pos_healPtr_dir;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            pos_healPtr_dir.emplace_back(positions[i],&healths[i],directions[i]);
        }
        sort(pos_healPtr_dir.begin(), pos_healPtr_dir.end());
        
        //from l to r, R
        stack<int*> stk;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            auto[p,h,d] =pos_healPtr_dir[i];
            
            if(d=='R'){
                stk.push(h);
            }
            else{
                while(!stk.empty() && *stk.top()<*h){//trim top
                    *stk.top()=0; stk.pop();
                    (*h)--;
                }
                if(!stk.empty() && *stk.top()==*h){//same h
                    *stk.top()=0; stk.pop();

                    *h=0;
                }
                else{//stk.empty, cur survive
                    if(!stk.empty()) std::cout << "error" << std::endl;
                    //h is left and will not collid in future
                }
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> res;
        for(auto h: healths){
            if(h!=0) res.push_back(h);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
