There is a row of `n` houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x 3` cost matrix `costs`.

- For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with the color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...

Return *the minimum cost to paint all houses*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: costs = [[7,6,2]]
Output: 2

```

**Constraints:**

- `costs.length == n`
- `costs[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        int n = costs.size(); if(n==0) return 0;
        int color0=0,color1=0,color2=0;
        for(auto c:costs){
            int c0=c[0];
            int c1=c[1];
            int c2=c[2];
            
            int nxtColor0=min(color1,color2)+c0;
            int nxtColor1=min(color0,color2)+c1;
            int nxtColor2=min(color0,color1)+c2;
            
            color0 = nxtColor0;
            color1 = nxtColor1;
            color2 = nxtColor2;
        }
        
        return min({color0,color1,color2});
    }
};
```
