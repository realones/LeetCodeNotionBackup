You are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of `0`. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`) which reduces the size of the array by `1`. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return `true` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return `true`. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2.
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2).
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5.
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 107`

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool predictTheWinner(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();//1~20
        vector<int> prefixSum(nums);
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            prefixSum[i]+=prefixSum[i-1];
        }

        vector<vector<int>> dp(n,vector<int>(n,0));
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            dp[i][i]=nums[i];
        }

        for(int len=2;len<=n;len++){
            for(int l=0,r;r=l+len-1,r<n;l++){
                dp[l][r]=max(
                    getPrefixSum(prefixSum,l,r)-dp[l+1][r],
                    getPrefixSum(prefixSum,l,r)-dp[l][r-1]
                );
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n-1]*2 >= accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(),0);
    }

    int getPrefixSum(vector<int>& prefixSum, int l, int r){
        return prefixSum[r] - (l==0?0:prefixSum[l-1]);
    }
}
```
