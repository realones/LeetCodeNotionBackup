Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return *the researcher's h-index*.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1

```

**Constraints:**

- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int res=0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            int cnt=n-i;
            int val=nums[i];
            int h=min(val,cnt);
            res=max(res,h);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

/*
find max h that
cnt of (val >=h) is >=h
*/
```
