Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns **the span** of that stock's price for the current day.

The **span** of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day.

- For example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is `[7,2,1,2]` and the price of the stock today is `2`, then the span of today is `4` because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal `2` for `4` consecutive days.
- Also, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is `[7,34,1,2]` and the price of the stock today is `8`, then the span of today is `3` because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal `8` for `3` consecutive days.

Implement the `StockSpanner` class:

- `StockSpanner()` Initializes the object of the class.
- `int next(int price)` Returns the **span** of the stock's price given that today's price is `price`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]
Output
[null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]

Explanation
StockSpanner stockSpanner = new StockSpanner();
stockSpanner.next(100); // return 1
stockSpanner.next(80);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(70);  // return 2
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(75);  // return 4, because the last 4 prices (including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.
stockSpanner.next(85);  // return 6

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= price <= 105`
- At most `104` calls will be made to `next`.

Solution:

感觉是next larger/smaller one的变体，但是思路不题通顺，对于init(intmax,0)也不是也通畅，虽然implement不难，但是要深入理解解法

```cpp
using ii=pair<int,int>;

class StockSpanner {
public:
    int day=0;
    stack<ii> stk;//val, day

    StockSpanner() {
        stk.push({INT_MAX,-1});
    }
    
    int next(int price) {
        while(stk.top().first<=price) stk.pop();
        int res=day - stk.top().second;
        stk.push({price,day});
        day++;
        return res;
    }
};

/**
 * Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * StockSpanner* obj = new StockSpanner();
 * int param_1 = obj->next(price);
 */

/*
for each day, get span : [...cur], cur is max, the lengh

for pre elements, [cur] is next smaller one of [l], return cur-l+1

stk record dec ones

*/
```
