related: Binary Tree Cameras (Binary%20Tree%20Cameras%200a1832b41abe4e978c255a5862f62f3d.md), House Robber (House%20Robber%20e654ada840b84406a958d430aba01166.md)

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given the `root` of the binary tree, return *the maximum amount of money the thief can rob **without alerting the police***.

**Example 1:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob1-tree.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

```

**Example 2:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob2-tree.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 104`

================================

comment: very similar to “Binary Tree Cameras”

todo: huahua has more solutions

Solution stateMachine:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */

using ii=pair<int,int>;//robbed, skipped

class Solution {
public:
    int rob(TreeNode* root) {
        auto [robbed, skipped] = helper(root);
        return max(robbed, skipped);
    }

    //return {robbed, skipped}
    ii helper(TreeNode* root){
        if(!root) return {INT_MIN,0};
        if(!root->left && !root->right) return {root->val,0};
        auto [lr, ls] = helper(root->left);
        auto [rr, rs] = helper(root->right);
        int robbed=ls+rs + root->val;
        int skipped=max(lr,ls) + max(rr,rs);
        return {robbed, skipped};
    }
};
