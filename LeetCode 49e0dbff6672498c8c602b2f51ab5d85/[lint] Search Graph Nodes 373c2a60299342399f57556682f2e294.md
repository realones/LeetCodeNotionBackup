Given a `undirected graph`, a `node` and a `target`, return the nearest node to given node which value of it is target, return `NULL` if you can't find.

There is a `mapping` store the nodes' values in the given parameters.

Example:
Example 1:

```
Input:
{1,2,3,4#2,1,3#3,1,2#4,1,5#5,4}
[3,4,5,50,50]
1
50
Output:
4
Explanation:
2------3  5
\\     |  |
 \\    |  |
  \\   |  |
   \\  |  |
     1 --4
Give a node 1, target is 50

there a hash named values which is [3,4,10,50,50], represent:
Value of node 1 is 3
Value of node 2 is 4
Value of node 3 is 10
Value of node 4 is 50
Value of node 5 is 50

Return node 4

```

Example 2:

```
Input:
{1,2#2,1}
[0,1]
1
1
Output:
2

```
