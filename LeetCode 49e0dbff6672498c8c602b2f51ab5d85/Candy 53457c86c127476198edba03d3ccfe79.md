There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return *the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

```

**Constraints:**

- `n == ratings.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`

Solution: multiset

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size(); if(n==0) {return 0;}
        //small val to large val, dup so use multi set instead of map
        multiset<pair<int,int>> val_idx;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            val_idx.insert({nums[i],i});
        }
        
        unordered_map<int,int> idx_can;//idx_candies
        
        int total=0;
        for(auto [v,i]: val_idx){
            int can=1;
            if(i-1>=0 && idx_can[i-1] && v>nums[i-1]) can=max(can,idx_can[i-1]+1);
            if(i+1< n && idx_can[i+1] && v>nums[i+1]) can=max(can,idx_can[i+1]+1);
            idx_can[i]=can;
            total+=can;
        }
        
        return total;
    }
};

//at least 1 candy
//higher val, more candie than nei
//return min total of candies
```
