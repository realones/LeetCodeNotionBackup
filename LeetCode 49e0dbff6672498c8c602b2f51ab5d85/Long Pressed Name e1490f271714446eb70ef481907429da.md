Your friend is typing his `name` into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character `c`, the key might get *long pressed*, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the `typed` characters of the keyboard. Return `True` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation:'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation:'e' must have been pressed twice, but it was not in the typed output.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= name.length, typed.length <= 1000`
- `name` and `typed` consist of only lowercase English letters.

a littble bit to implement

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isLongPressedName(string name, string typed) {
        int i=0,j=0;//name idx, typed idx
        while(i<name.size()){
            if(i==name.size()-1 || name[i]!=name[i+1]){
                while(j+1<typed.size() && typed[j+1]==typed[j]) j++;
            }
            if(name[i]==typed[j]){i++,j++;}
            else return false;
        }
        return i==name.size() && j==typed.size();
    }
};
/*
special char:
    if end/ if nxt is not same
    check typed: if can consume more
*
```
