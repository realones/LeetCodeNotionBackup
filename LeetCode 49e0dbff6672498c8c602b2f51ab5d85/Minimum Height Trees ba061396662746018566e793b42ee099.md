A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by *exactly* one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`)  are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return *a list of all **MHTs'** root labels*. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

**Example 1:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/e1.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/e1.jpg)

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: [1]
Explanation: As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

```

**Example 2:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/e2.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/e2.jpg)

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]
Output: [3,4]

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- All the pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.
- The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMinHeightTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        if(n==1) return {0};
        unordered_map<int,unordered_set<int>> g;//u-[v]
        unordered_map<int,int> ind;
        for(auto& e: edges){
            int u=e[0], v=e[1];
            g[u].insert(v);
            g[v].insert(u);
            ind[u]++;
            ind[v]++;
        }
        //topSort, only when ind become 1 (leaves) then push into queue
        queue<int> q;
        for(auto [node,d]: ind){
            if(d==1) {
                q.push(node);
            }
        }
        vector<int> res;
        while(!q.empty()){
            int sz=q.size();
            res.clear();
            for(int i=0; i<sz; i++){
                int u=q.front(); q.pop();
                res.push_back(u);
                for(auto v: g[u]){
                    ind[v]--;
                    if(ind[v]==1){
                        q.push(v);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};

solution brute force:
    for each node, treat as root - O(V)
        find max depth - O(V)
    T: O(V^2)
    S: O(V)

Intui
    between any two nodes, there exist only one path, name it as the distance
    For the tree-alike graph, the number of centroids is no more than 2.
        for any of the cases that have more than 2 centroids, they must form a cycle among the centroids, which is contradicted to our condition.
Algorithm
    from leaves to core, layer by layer
Implementation
    build adj list
    bfs from leaves to core
        queue init with leaves (ind ==1)
        while q!empty
            pop cur node
            put no-visited linked node into queue
            the last layer is what we want(<=2 nodes non-visited)
Complexity
    T: O(V): building graph and bfs
    S: O(V): graph
