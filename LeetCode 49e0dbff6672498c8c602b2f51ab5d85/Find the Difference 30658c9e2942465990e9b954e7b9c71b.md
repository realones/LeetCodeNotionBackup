You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

```cpp
class Solution {
public: 
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        char res=0;
        for(auto c: s) res^=c;
        for(auto c: t) res^=c;
        return res;
    }
};
```
