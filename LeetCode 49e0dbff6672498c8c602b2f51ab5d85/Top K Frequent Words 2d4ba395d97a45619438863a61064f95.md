Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *most frequent strings*.

Return the answer **sorted** by **the frequency** from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their **lexicographical order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 500`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `k` is in the range `[1, The number of **unique** words[i]]`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve it in `O(n log(k))` time and `O(n)` extra space?

not stream, no need LFU

convert to hashmap and put into pq

```cpp
class MyComp{
public:
    bool operator()(pair<string,int> a,pair<string,int> b) {
        return a.second > b.second || (a.second == b.second && a.first < b.first);
    }    
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> topKFrequent(vector<string>& words, int k) {
        unordered_map<string, int> freq;
        for(auto w : words){
            freq[w]++;
        }
        
        typedef priority_queue< pair<string,int>, vector<pair<string,int>>, MyComp > my_priority_queue_t;
        my_priority_queue_t  pq;
        
        for(auto w : freq ){
            pq.emplace(w.first, w.second);
            if(pq.size()>k) pq.pop();
        }
        
        vector<string> output;
        while(!pq.empty()){
            output.insert(output.begin(), pq.top().first);
            pq.pop();
        }
        return output;
    }
};
```
